Let’s set the record straight.

There are a couple reasons your upline begins by telling you to make a list of everybody you know.

First, it’s the quickest and hopefully easiest way to get someone else to see the products or hear the pitch. Your upline depends on more people seeing the opportunity. They depend on YOU to get them in front of more eyes and ears.

This only benefits you if done correctly. If you sound too needy or desperate then you may lose your friends or family before they even see the offer. Your upline will then just want you to move on to the next person. However, if approached correctly, this will be the quickest way to add someone to your team or customer list!

Second, your list is now their list!

The traditional way of network marketing is to contact anyone you can (appropriately called the “3-foot-rule”). You're expected to strike up a conversation with the person in line with you at the coffee shop. For some people that comes easy.

Once you find a new teammate, repeat the process! Get them to contact everyone they can. It always starts with a list of people you know then expands to anyone you can meet and talk to.

I'm not saying that is a bad thing. Gaining skills to talk to other people AND to make them feel important will serve you for years to come.

However, it's not leverage. Even if you become great at it, you're still only talking to one person at a time (typically).

*There is a better way.*

What if you could learn how to only target people that WANT to hear about your opportunity?\n\nIf you’re interested, read this post: [Why MLM Leaders are Secretly Using the Internet to Build, While Telling Their Downline to Keep It "Old School."][1]

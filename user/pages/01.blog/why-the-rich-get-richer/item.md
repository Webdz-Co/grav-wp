Rich people buy or build assetsThink about it. What do you buy with your money? Gadgets? Savings? "Investments"?

None of these pay you well.

===
An asset is anything that pays you month after month. You buy it (or build it) once and it keeps paying you!

You have a choice what you spend your money on. Spend it on assets!

You don't have any extra money to buy assets? Build them!

You may not want to hear this right now...because you may already have a preconceived idea in your head. Network 
marketing (a.k.a. MLM, direct sales, social marketing) is a time-tested and legitimate way to build an asset without 
much money! It only requires your time and dedication!

Don't have the time? Keep spending money on "get rich quick" schemes. They have worked out for you so far...right?

## Here's the Thing

If you choose a network marketing company that you believe in, YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO SELL ANYTHING!

Surely you have used a product that you liked so much you ended up telling other people about it enthusiastically.

That's called free marketing for someone else's product.

Were you hurt if someone said "no?" Of course your weren't. You have no financial ties to that product.

Find a product that you can recommend enthusiastically...that also rewards you for your actions. But keep the same 
frame of mind! Not every product is for everybody.

You have to understand that you're not selling anything!

You are simply inviting people to understand that there is a lot of money to be made by building an asset...through 
a product (and company) that you truly believe in.

## Everybody Wins

Network marketing exists because it's one of the best (and cheapest) forms of advertising.

Hearing from a trusted friend how great a product is...that is the ultimate recommendation. And instead of wasting 
money on commercials and billboards that *might* reach their target audience, it's much cheaper for a company to pay 
you to advertise for them.

The advertising message is also sincere and targeted.

Again, you're not selling anything. You are inviting and recommending. And you must not be emotionally attached when 
someone declines. Ultimately, it does not matter to you! I'll explain that in a bit.

## Choosing the Right Product or Service

## Why Network Marketing Gets a Bad Name

## A Numbers Game (or why a "no" is meaningless)

To be successful in network marketing, you have to become a bigger person. You have to spend time on personal 
development.

You also have to talk to a lot of people. The majority will say no.

Every no is a success!

Let me repeat that, EVERY NO IS A SUCCESS!!

First of all, a lot of them could be a timing thing. Many people do not think they have the time to put into a new 
business. At least not when you talk to them the first (or second or third) time. Never sound "needy" and always pay 
attention to their reasoning.

The most important thing is they now know what you are doing! If someone else approaches them with the same opportunity 
down the line, they may remember you. They may have said no at the time you approach them, but they know what you are 
doing!

That's one reason it's important to talk to as many people as soon as possible.

Secondly, you need seven to nine "no's" in order to get one "yes." This is where I have to recommend the audio CD 
"Building Your Network Marketing Business" by Jim Rohn. A copy comes with your IDLife Business Builder Kit if you join.

That may sound like a lot of rejection to you but it's even more reason why every no is a success!!

Can you handle a few rejections to build an asset that will be worth a couple hundred dollars or even a few thousand 
dollars per month?

I can.

You only need a few yes's!

A few!

Start with a goal of three and you will get rich.

Yes, you may have to show the plan to 30 people to get there but you're building an asset!

This is where I have to recommend "The Compound Effect" by Darren Hardy.

I'm all about health, wealth, and happiness.

Health involves eating nutritious foods (most of the time) and exercising. If you want to be healthy, you can't keep drinking diet sodas. (Warning: Jumping on <soapbox>) On a good/bad scale from one to ten with ten being the worst, regular sodas are a 10 and diet sodas are an 11. I roll my eyes everytime I'm heading into the grocery store and see an overweight person pushing around a cart with a ton of diet soda...and they think they're being good! There is no nutrition in that whatsoever...and a bunch of negative research on the effects of artificial sweeteners.</soapbox>

You will also see better results with some kind of HIIT workout. Jogging/walking 30 minutes or more will not help. Running marathons will, in my obsessively researched opinion, do more harm than good. I'm a fan of CrossFit when coached properly **but** there are plenty of other workouts if that's not your thing. Whole body weight training of some kind is great!

Wealth is hard to define. Personally it aligns very much with happiness for me but not in the rolling around in a wad of cash, greedy, kind of way. Sure, I like money but only as a measure of how much value I'm providing to others.

It's about **time** and financial freedom. It's about NOT having to wake up to an alarm to go to a J-O-B you hate.

Happiness is about being able to do what you want, when you want, with the people you want more often than not. Sure, everything has sacrifices. You may have to do a few things you don't like every now and then to become successful. However, even most of that stuff could be outsourced if you want!

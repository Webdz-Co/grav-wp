A website should be your central source of content. (Even if you are just doing videos!)

You need a resource you **own** to be a central hub for all your content.

A place to call home and *create your brand*.

### Creating Your Central Hub

Yes, you should give value on other platforms and social media but you don't own those resources.

You don't control Facebook. You can't determine when you'll show up in somebody's feed or when it will disappear among the sea of other posts.

Every piece of content you provide on other people's networks needs to point to a resource that you control.

So you can write a blog post or shoot a video for your website. **Then** you post a link or place an advertisement to that piece of content on social media.

Your content will **always** be there and you can point anything you want to it at any time and as often as you desire!

### Building A Reusable Resource

Build your website/blog to serve a specific need.

Decide exactly who you want to help, what problems they have, and what solutions you can provide.

Some people still worry about SEO for traffic. All you need to do is write content in a way that solves problems for people that are looking for the answer. That will provide some search traffic.

Beyond that you advertise you the people that need your solution in the places that those people are hanging out.

Yes, you have to learn some basic marketing skills but it's nothing scary and it will serve you in all areas of your business.

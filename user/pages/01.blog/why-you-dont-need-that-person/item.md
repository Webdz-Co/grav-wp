Ever catch yourself in need of a new associate to rank advance? (Umm, always!)

And you just talked to someone recently that is interested? (Good work by the way!)

Don't assume things will work out perfectly. Don't assume they will join and you'll rank advance.

===

If you're thinking this way you're thinking small and playing from a weak position. You may even end up coming off as "needy" and driving them away.

Remember, this is a numbers game. If you have someone in decision mode then keep after them **but keep following the numbers.**

Hopefully you're focused on getting more than one prospect at a time. However, if you're goal is one prospect then talk to ten people! Don't get hung up waiting on the decision of one person.
